    <br><h3>"nom nom nom" -- Gerard while eating noodles on stage, probably</h3> 
Who doesn't love a good noodle dish? Gerard of The Black Parade sure loves his noodles, as seen during the Draag North American tour during the summer 2025. Gerard was seen stuffing as much spaghetti noodles into his mouth as he could while he should have been performing on stage! If you, too, would like to enjoy the on-stage delicacy, here is a handy recipe for Garlic Butter Noodles inspired by Gerard's favorite. 

    <br><h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Whole grain spagetti noodles</li>
            <ul><li>Or regular spaghetti noodles, but whole grain is probably preffered by Gerard since he is from Draag (the worlds biggest wheat product exporter)</li></ul>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Garlic, powdered</li>
        <li>Parmesean cheese (optional)</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

        <li>Add the pasta into the pot and stir</li>
